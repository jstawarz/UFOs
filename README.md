# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis

In this analysis, we are working with Dana, a data journalist who is writing an article about UFOs. As part of her project, Dana has been reviewing a
Javascript file filled with information about UFO sightings. To accompany her online article, Dana would like to display this data as an HTML webpage
in order to further back up her findings.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to update the HTML webpage to allow the Javascript data to be filtered. The filters on this data will allow for users
to filter on multiple criteria to find specific UFO sightings matching the desired description

## Results

After updating the code to add the requested filters, the new webpage is shown below.

From this point, the user can input data into the filters to locate specific UFO sightings included in the data. As in the example below,
the filters have been updated to show UFO sightings in Massachusetts that are triangular. Once the filters have filled out the the desired 
information, the user only has to click the Enter button and the table will filter with the matching results.

## Summary of Results

One drawback of the webpage design is that once the filters have been populated with information, there is no easy way to clear the filter.
As it is currently, the user would need to delete each line of data and then re-filter the table to show the new search results. 

In terms of futher development, one recommendation could be to add a button that would clear the filters to allow for an easier experience
of executing multiple searches. 

A second recommendation could be to add additional filters to the webpage. Currently, there is no filter for duration. Since the times vary
greatly, the filter could be different from the others and allow for a drop-down with pre-selected options for filtering the data, i.e 
Less than 1 min, Between 1 min and 5 mins, etc.
